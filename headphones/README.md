# ALX HTML & CSS Project: Headphones

## Project Overview
This project is a web development exercise focused on creating a responsive webpage for showcasing headphones. The webpage will adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile views, providing an engaging and user-friendly experience across devices.

## Features and Interactions
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage automatically switches to a mobile-friendly version when the screen width is 480px or less.
- **Link Hover/Active State**: Links change color to `#FF6565` when hovered over or active.
- **Button Hover/Active State**: Buttons become slightly transparent with an opacity of `0.9` when hovered over or active.
- **Content Layout**: The content has a maximum width of 1000px and is centered on the page for optimal readability.

## Repository Structure
The project is housed in the `alx_html_css` GitHub repository, within the `headphones` directory. Below is an overview of the directory structure:
